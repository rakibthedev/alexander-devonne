                question: "WHAT IS PSD2?",
                answer: `PSD2 is a new European law introduced to make online payments more secure. It will impact customers in the European Economic Area (EEA) and customers using EU bank accounts. When you place an order online using a card payment, your bank may ask you to confirm your identity through 3D Secure authentication.
                    What are the payment steps when I place an order?
                    When you place an order within Europe, you may be directed to a 3D Secure authentication by your bank. There are many ways to authenticate online payments and you could be asked to confirm your identity through SMS, email, or TouchID. Once your payment is authenticated and the order has been placed, you’ll return to the confirmation page. As soon as your order has been confirmed, you’ll receive an email.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    How will my bank confirm my identity?
                    Get in contact with your bank to understand their 3D Secure authentication process. Make sure they have the correct contact details for you just in case they use SMS or email for authentication.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If I'm unable to place an order, what should I do?
                    If something didn't go quite right, you may contact our Customer Service team.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                        In pre-order purchases, credit cards are debited at the moment the order is placed.

            question: '1. Scope of Application',
            answer: `1.1     These general terms and conditions of sale (the “General Terms and Conditions”) apply to all sales contracts entered into between Off-White Operating S.r.l., with registered office in via Turati, 12, Milan, 20121 (MI), VAT No. 08436950961, registered in the Companies Registry of Milan under No. 2026193, subject to the management and coordination of New Guards Group Holding S.p.A. (“Off-White” or the “Company”) and the customer, who may be referenced as a “consumer” under the applicable consumer protection legislation (the “Customer”).
<br>

Off-White and the Customer are hereinafter jointly referred to as the “Parties” and individually as “Party”.
<br>

1.2     The Customer must read these General Terms and Conditions carefully. By checking the “I accept the General Terms and Conditions” box during the shopping cart checkout the Customer accepts these General Terms and Conditions. By accepting the General Terms and Conditions, the Customer agrees to be bound by their provisions. If the Customer does not accept the General Terms and Conditions, the Customer may not purchase “Off-White” products through the Website (as defined in Section 1.4 below). Therefore, the Customer is invited to print and save a copy of the General Terms and Conditions for future reference.
<br>

1.3     Off-White is part of the Farfetch group (a UK platform active in online sales of fashion, luxury and design goods, “Farfetch”): as better described below, Farfetch manages certain services on behalf of Off-White which are connected to the purchase of “Off-White” branded products and, specifically, payment processing and invoicing, product delivery services and an after-sales assistance service to Customers. The after-sales service will be managed by Farfetch and may be provided to the Customer also in a language other than that of the country in which the consumer resides or of which they are a citizen (such as, for example, English).
<br>

1.4     The General Terms and Conditions govern the Company’s marketing and sales, including of “Off-White” branded products (as well as any digital content and/or services, the “Products”), via the e-commerce website www.alexanderdevonne.com (the “Website”).
<br>

1.5     The General Terms and Conditions do not govern the Website provision of services or the sale of products by parties other than Off-White and Farfetch, even if they are present on the Website through links, banners or other hypertext links.
<br>

1.6     Off-White can be contacted at ecommerce@alexanderdevonne.com and on +44 808 196 1114.
<br>

1.7     Purchasing Products through the Website is strictly reserved for persons who:
<br>

(i)    have legal capacity and have reached the legal age in their country of residence; and
<br>

(ii)   purchase the Products for personal use and not for purposes related to commercial, business or professional activities.
<br>

1.8     Off-White will not accept and/or process orders from channels other than the Website or from persons who do not meet the requirements set out in the above paragraph.`
        },
        {
            question: '2. Conclusion of the Agreement',
            answer: `2.1     The sending of a purchase order by the Customer (the “Order”) constitutes acceptance of the offer to the public made by Off-White through the Website, and, therefore, receipt of the Order by the Company constitutes the conclusion of a binding sales contract with respect to the Products selected by the Customer, which shall be entirely governed by the General Terms and Conditions in force at the time of its conclusion (the “Agreement”).
<br>

2.2     Before confirming and sending the Order, the Customer must therefore check the summary to ensure that the Products selected and all data provided are correct (for example the Customer may change the quantity of Products that they intend to purchase by adding or removing one or more of them from the virtual shopping cart).
<br>

2.3     Once the Order has been received, Off-White sends the Customer an e-mail confirming receipt of the Order, containing the number and details of the Order made (“Order Confirmation”).
<br>

2.4     Subsequently, Off-White will confirm to the Customer that the Order is being shipped (“Shipment Confirmation”), with the timing depending on the type of shipment that the Customer has selected.
<br>

2.5     The Customer must keep the order number on the Order Confirmation to access the after-sales assistance service and for any other communications with the Company.`

        {
            question: '3. Product Availability',
            answer: `3.1     The Customer may purchase a maximum number of 3 (three) items of the same measure/size per Product.

3.2     Off-White constantly monitors and updates the stock availability of the Products displayed on the Website. Nevertheless, since the Website may be visited simultaneously by various Customers, it is possible that more than one Customer intend to purchase or purchase the same Product at the same time. In such cases, the Product may result to be available for a short time, while actually out of stock or no longer available. If a Product is unavailable for these reasons or in other cases of unavailability, Off-White shall inform the Customer promptly and in any event within 5 (five) business days at the contact details provided by the Customer.`
        },
        {
            question: '4. Purchase procedure',
            answer: `4.1     To purchase a Product through the Website, the Customer may create and/or access the Customer’s account through the account area on the Website or place the Order as a guest without creating an account (“guest” mode). If the Customer makes a “guest” purchase, the Customer must correctly fill in the fields of the relevant form on the Website each time a new purchase is made, entering all the data required therein (e.g. first name, last name, billing and delivery address, e-mail address and telephone number) necessary to perform the Agreement.
<br>

4.2     The description and essential characteristics of the Products, including details and composition, fit, colours and sizes (where applicable) are presented on the Website within each product sheet together with one or more photographic images in digital format. Although Off-White takes measures to ensure that the photographs shown on the Website are faithful reproductions of the original products, the images and colours of the Products offered for sale on the Website may not be perfectly representative of their real characteristics due to the browser and/or devices used to access the Website. Further, Off-White is not responsible for pricing, typographical, or other errors in any offer and Off-White reserves the right to cancel any orders arising from such errors. Off-White is not, therefore, liable for any errors or inconsistency of the graphic representations of the Products or the descriptions or pricing shown on the Website (collectively, “Product Variations”).
<br>

4.3     Without prejudice to Orders already sent and/or Agreements already entered into, Off-White reserves the right to remove any Product from the Website at any time, including for commercial reasons relating to the seasonality of the products.
<br>

4.4     To send an Order, the Customer must place the Products to be purchased in the Website’s virtual shopping cart.
<br>

4.5     Before completing the purchase, the Customer must confirm that the contents of the shopping cart are correct and enter any promotional code in the appropriate section. The promotional code, if valid, will be immediately applied to the amount displayed in the shopping cart. The Customer will then be asked to select the payment method, indicate the billing address, select the chosen shipping method and specify the shipping address if different from the billing address.
<br>

4.6     By placing the Order - after accepting the General Terms and Conditions - and clicking on “pay now”, the Customer expressly acknowledges and accepts the payment obligation. Therefore, after placing the Order, full cost of the purchase, including the price of the Product, and applicable shipping and handling costs will be charged to the Customer through the payment method selected by the Customer.`
        },
        {
            question: '5. Price and Payment Methods',
            answer: `5.1     The price of the Products indicated on the Website (the “Price”), expressed in Euros or in other local currency that may be applicable, is inclusive of all applicable taxes and charges. Shipping costs are also included in the Price, unless otherwise indicated on the Website and communicated to the Customer at the checkout stage of the shopping cart before the Order is sent (e.g. in the event that a faster shipping method than the standard shipping method is available in the territory and can be selected by the Customer).
<br>

5.2     Off-White reserves the right to change the Price at any time, but this will not apply to Orders already placed and Agreements already entered into.
<br>

5.3     The payment methods for the Price and any costs for shipping available to the Customer are, depending on the country:
<br>

(i)    credit card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Diners, Discover, JCB and Union Pay) for all countries we ship to;
<br>

(ii)   Paypal, Apple Pay, Alipay (for mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan), Sofort (for Germany, Belgium, Austria and Switzerland), iDeal (for the Netherlands); and
<br>

(iii)  Klarna (USA, UK, Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland).
<br>

5.4     The payment service is operated by a third-party payment provider (the provider varies, depending on the payment method that the Customer has selected). During the payment procedure, an additional payment authentication may be requested by the card issuer or banking institution (such as for the “Verified by Visa” and “MasterCard Secure Code” programs). Under no circumstances can Off-White be held liable for payment errors through the third-party payment service occurring due to lack of connection or for direct and/or indirect damages that the Customer may suffer for any reason or cause as a result and as a consequence of suspensions or interruptions in the operation of a card issuer’s or banking institution’s systems (including any cyberattacks).
<br>

5.5     Off-White will perform, through the third-party payment service provider, a standard pre-authorisation on the payment method the Customer has selected. If, for any reason (for example, relating to inadequate/insufficient payment details provided by the Customer), it is not possible to charge the Price, the purchase process will be automatically cancelled, no Agreement will be formed and the Order will not be sent to Off-White. Due to the failure to enter into the Agreement, Off-White will have no delivery obligation towards the Customer, nor may the Customer claim payment of any indemnity and/or compensation for damages.
<br>

5.6     The invoice or, more generally, the tax document relating to the purchase of the Products and the provision of services is sent by email to the Customer by Farfetch (and, specifically, by the Dutch company Farfetch Europe Trading B.V, VAT registration number IE3721596NH, for purchases of Products located within the territory of the European Union at the time of the sale, or by Farfetch UK Limited, VAT registration number GB 204 0769 35, for purchases of Products located within the territory of the United Kingdom at the time of the sale), which manages the payment and invoicing service on behalf of Off-White. For VAT purposes, Articles 14(2)(c) and 28 (if applicable) of Directive 2006/112/EC apply for the territory of the European Union, and Section 47 (if applicable) of the VAT Act 1994 applies for the territory of the United Kingdom. The billing method does not affect the Agreement entered into with Off-White or the related rights guaranteed to consumers by applicable law. Once issued, the invoice/tax document can no longer be modified.
<br>

5.7     By means of the option “pay in 3 instalments without interest”, Klarna (Swedish payment service provider, “Klarna”) provides for the possibility of deferring the payment of the Price in three equal instalments. Payments for each instalment will be automatically charged to the Customer with the payment method selected by the Customer. The first instalment is charged to the Customer at the time the Order is placed in accordance with Article 4.6; the second and third instalments are charged 30 (thirty) and 60 (sixty) days later, respectively (unless otherwise indicated on the Website by Klarna). More information on the terms and conditions for using the payment instalment service offered by Klarna can be found here.`

        {
            question: '6. Shipping and delivery',
            answer: `6.1     The purchased Products are delivered to the Customer by shipment to the delivery address indicated by the Customer in the Order.
<br>

6.2     Shipping costs and times depend on the type of shipment selected by the Customer during the purchase process and indicated in the Order. The types of shipping available vary from area to area. Specifically, in certain areas the Customer may choose between standard and express shipping (where available), as better described on the Website on the shopping cart checkout page. More information on delivery costs and times can be found here.
<br>

6.3     The Parties agree that the delivery times indicated on the Website are purely illustrative and not guaranteed, and that in any event delivery will be made within 30 (thirty) days from the formation of the Agreement. After receiving Shipment Confirmation, the Customer can monitor the status of the shipment from the account area on the Website and/or the courier’s website with the shipment tracking number provided in the Shipment Confirmation.
<br>

6.4     Upon delivery of the Products by the courier, the Customer (or a representative of the Customer) must verify: (i) that the recipient’s details on the delivery receipt are correct; and (ii) the integrity of the packaging and seals.
<br>

6.5     Any damage to the packaging, seals that have been altered in any way and/or discrepancies with respect to the recipient’s references or documentation must be immediately indicated in writing on the courier’s delivery receipt (signature subject to inspection).
<br>
6.6     It is understood between the Parties that orders consisting of several Products may be delivered in several shipments.`

            question: '5. PERSONAL DATA METHODS CARRIED OUT BY OFF-WHITE',
            answer: `Summary: We store Personal Data securely, but there is no such thing as perfect data security.

Off-White takes great care in implementing, enforcing and maintaining the security of the Personal Data we process. Personal Data collected through the Site is processed by digital and electronic methods and tools, adopting security measures to minimize the risk of confidentiality, integrity and availability breaches. Off-White implements, enforces and maintains security measures, technologies and policies to prevent the unauthorized or accidental access to or destruction, loss, modification, use or disclosure of Personal Data. We likewise take steps to monitor compliance of such policies on an ongoing basis. Where we deem it necessary in light of the nature of the data in question and the risks to Data Subjects, we may encrypt data. As noted above, we also endeavor to delete Personal Data which no longer serves its purpose. Likewise, we take industry standard steps to ensure our Sites and application are safe.

However, these measures, due to the nature of the online transmission methos, cannot limit or absolutely exclude the risk of unauthorized access, leaks, viruses and other data security breaches will never occur.

Within Off-White, we endeavor to limit access to Personal Data to those of our personnel who: (i) require access in order for Off-White to fulfil its obligations under law and contract, and under this Privacy Policy, and (ii) have been appropriately and periodically trained on the requirements applicable to the processing, care and handling of the Personal Data, and (iii) are under confidentiality obligations as may be required under applicable law.

Off-White will act in accordance with its policies and with applicable law to promptly notify, where so required, the relevant authorities and Data Subjects in the event that any Personal Data processed by Off-White is lost, stolen, or where there has been any unauthorized access to it, all in accordance with applicable law and on the instructions of qualified authority.

It is recommended that you periodically check that your computer is equipped with adequate software to protect the network transmission of data, both incoming and outgoing (such as updated antivirus systems) and that the Internet service provider has taken appropriate measures to ensure the security of network data transmission (such as firewalls and spam filters).
